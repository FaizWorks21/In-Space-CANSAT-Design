## 🪂 1. Main Parachute Compartment
The **topmost compartment** securely houses the **main parachute**, which is also tied to this module.  
It integrates **two servo motors** responsible for releasing the parachute lid upon reaching a specific altitude.

- Contains: Main parachute (folded), 2× release servos  
- Function: Controlled deployment of the main parachute  
- Location: Topmost cylindrical section  
- Material: PLA+  
- Mounting: Fixed on carbon fiber rods with clamps  

---

## 🧢 2. Main Parachute Lid
Positioned above the main parachute compartment, the **lid** is connected to the **drogue parachute** and held in place by two servos.  
When the system detects the target altitude, the servos rotate to release the lid, triggering the main parachute deployment sequence.

- Mechanism: Dual-servo release  
- Connection: Tied with drogue parachute  
- Function: Seals main chute compartment until release  
- Material: PLA+  

---

## 🦾 3. Carbon Fiber Rods
The structure is reinforced using **four 4mm carbon fiber rods** that extend through all compartments.  
These rods ensure **vertical alignment, strength, and stability**, providing a rigid cylindrical frame.

- Quantity: 4 rods  
- Diameter: 4 mm  
- Purpose: Structural alignment and load-bearing  
- Material: Carbon Fiber  

---

## 🔩 4. Clamps
The **red clamps** are used to lock each compartment onto the carbon fiber rods.  
They are fastened using **M2 screws and nuts**, ensuring secure attachment and easy modular disassembly.

- Color: Red  
- Material: PLA+  
- Fasteners: M2 screws and nuts  
- Function: Structural locking and height adjustment  

---

## 🧠 5. PCB Plate
Mounted just below the parachute compartment, this **plate** acts as the main electronics deck.  
All the **sensors, microcontrollers, and communication modules** are attached here.

- Components Mounted: Sensors, microcontrollers, telemetry units  
- Material: FR4 or PLA+ base plate  
- Role: Electrical & sensor hub  
- Function: Integrates flight data processing and control logic  

---

## 🚨 6. Emergency Compartment
This compartment ensures **redundant safety** in case the main parachute fails to deploy.  
It houses the **emergency parachute**, a **servo-operated release door**, and a **spring-loaded mechanism** to eject the parachute.

- Components: Emergency chute, spring plate, servo motor  
- Function: Deploys backup parachute during main chute failure  
- Mechanism: Servo rotation releases spring-tensioned door  
- Material: PLA+  

---

## 🌀 7. Emergency Door
The **emergency door** seals the emergency compartment and holds the parachute in place.  
During an emergency trigger, the servo rotates the door, releasing the parachute outward.

- Type: Rotating latch door  
- Mechanism: Servo rotation-based  
- Function: Opens for emergency parachute ejection  
- Material: PLA+  

---

## ⚙️ 8. Gyro Assembly
The **gyro system** is an active stabilization module consisting of:
- **Outer ring**,  
- **Inner ring**,  
- **BLDC holder**, and  
- **Flywheel**.

It includes **2 servo motors** and **1 BLDC motor**:
- The **inner ring** is rotated by one servo mounted in the **outer ring**.
- The **second servo** rotates the **BLDC holder**, changing the flywheel axis.
- The **flywheel**, attached to the **BLDC motor**, provides stabilization via gyroscopic precession.

- Components: Outer ring, inner ring, BLDC holder, flywheel  
- Motors: 2× servos, 1× BLDC  
- Function: Attitude stabilization and orientation control  
- Material: PLA+ and metal components  

---

## 🔋 9. Battery Compartment
The **battery compartment** is located at the bottom and houses the **battery pack** and **power distribution system**.  
It supplies power to all electronics, including the servos, BLDC motor, sensors, and control units.

- Components: Battery pack, wiring, connectors, distribution board  
- Function: Centralized power management  
- Output: Regulated supply to sensors, servos, and controllers  
- Material: PLA+
